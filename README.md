# Machine-Learning-Specialization
This repository contains all the projects for the Coursera Machine Learning Specialization, from University of Washington.
All the activities of this specialization have been executed using Python 2.7 and the GraphLab Create machine learning package.

Obs: I have not finished the specialization yet. As I get done with more courses and activities, I will update this repo. :)
